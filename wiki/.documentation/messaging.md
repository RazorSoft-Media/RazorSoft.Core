### EventPublisher  
The `EventPublisher` provides a mechanism by which events (messages) can be published by any 
object (Publisher) with a view of the `EventMessage`. Any object with reference to the `EventMessage` 
has the ability to publish - that is, *distribute* - the message to all subscribers.

### CommandRouter  
The `CommandRouter` provides routing by which commands can be executed. What is unique about the 
`CommandRouter` is how commands are created. There are a couple of methods we can identify/create 
commands:  
* interface
* command object
* hybrid

Like publishing `EventMessage` messages, any object with a view (reference to) of a `Command` can 
execute the command.
