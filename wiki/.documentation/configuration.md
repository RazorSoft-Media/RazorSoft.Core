# RazorSoft.Core  
## Configuration
____________________________________________________________________________________________________  
[Home][1]  

We revive a settings & configuration staple with some modifications. These functions 
provide us with very modular configuration - that is, every library can have its own settings file. 
By default, setting files will be save with the `.settings` extension. The file is written in **JSON**.  

One difference is that the value is serialized. The library needs to have some updates that allows 
a plain, human readable section so users can make changes without special utility intervention.

May be useful to include other encoding or even encryption.

See the unit tests on how to use and implement.
